# Shit to check

* Mini: "Optimize World Server Map": Figure out how to fill PaperWorldMap, it needs a dim key which doesnt exist anymore?
* Mini: "MC-50319": fix if still works
* Make sure the flat bedrock setting doesn't do anything stupid
* Check DataBits foreach
* lighting is bork (load chunk, fly away, come back, everything or parts are black)
* block actions (particles/sounds) are bork (no chest opening, no bell, no noteblock)
